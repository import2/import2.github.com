<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>
    Using Import2, you can provide customers of your application with a dead-simple migration process from the
    app they are substituting with yours. With this guide we will explain and provide code snippets for all
    common integration scenarios.
</p>

<h2 id="app-registration">Registering Your Application</h2>
<p>
    Currently to register your app you have to contact us at
    <a href="mailto:hassle.free.migration@import2.com">hassle.free.migration@import2.com</a>.
    We will send you secret API token, which is required to perform API requests.
