<h1>Using the API</h1>
<p>
    Using Import2 API, you can provide customers of your application with a dead-simple migration process from the
    app they are substituting with yours. With this guide we will explain and provide code snippets for all
    common integration scenarios.
</p>

<h2 id="app-registration">Registering Your Application</h2>
<p>
    Currently to register your app you have to contact us at
    <a href="mailto:hassle.free.migration@import2.com">hassle.free.migration@import2.com"</a>.
    We will send you secret API token, which is required to perform API requests.
</p>

<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>
<p>
    Import2 API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. We expect to receive your API token as value of username parameter.
    Here is an example of using API token through curl:
</p>

{% codeblock %}
$ curl -u aafbdfde226327dafc73:X https://www.import2.com/api/v1/imports/3514012b6860e8
{% endcodeblock %}
