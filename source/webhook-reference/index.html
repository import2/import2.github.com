<h1 id="webhook-reference">Webhook Reference</h1>
<p>
    Import2 sends import status updates to the webhook URL specified while registering your application via HTTP Post request.
    Currently, webhook functionality <strong>doesn't re-send import status</strong> if your app was unreachable or has
    responded with an HTTP error.
</p>

<p>Webhook URL is called in the following cases:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Customer has started a new import</li>
    <li>Import2 has completed a sample import</li>
    <li>Import2 has completed a full import</li>
</ul>

<p>Payload example:</p>
{% codeblock %}
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id":"my-import-id",
    "token":"my-import-unique-token",
    "status_code":"scheduled",
    "status":"Sample Import in Progress",
    "users":{"source_tool":5, "destination_tool":4, "matched":3}
}
{% endcodeblock %}
