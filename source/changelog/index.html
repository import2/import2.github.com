<h1>Changelog</h1>

<h2>API v2 - August 2013</h2>

<p>
    API v2 includes only one significant change comparing to API v1: all imports created via API v2 start with a sample
    migration. Full import is scheduled only after customer expresses her desire for it. This adds one additional step
    into <a href="/custom-integration">Custom Integration</a> scenario: after the sample import is completed, customer
    has ability to request the full import. This could happen either by sending an e-mail to your helpdesk or by
    visiting a special page inside your app that explains required steps (e.g. upgrading from trial account to a paid
    one)
</p>

<h3>Required Migration Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Update all of your API requests to use <code>https://www.import2.com/api/<strong>v2</strong></code> as a base URL.
    </li>
    <li>
        Let us know if you prefer your customers to pay for the full import themselves or you would like to decide which
        customers qualify for the free full import (i.e. you will be covering their migration costs). In case of the
        former, if customer decides to perform a full import, she will be ask to purchase one of the Import2 paid packages.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have decided that you will be providing free full imports for qualifying customers, then let
        us know where we should direct customers requesting a full import (after customer has seen the sample is
        ready for full migration).
    </li>
</ol>
