<h2 id="workflow-functionality">Functionality to Implement</h2>

<p>This is the list of functionality that needs to be implemented in order to ensure the best experience for your
    customers.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Import page where customer is able to click on the tool she wishes to import her data from. Upon clicks your app
        should send an API request to Import2 and process response by storing import id and redirecting customer to a
        URL specified in response
    </li>
    <li>
        Import status page where customer is redirected after starting her import and where she can follow the progress
        of the import
    </li>
    <li>Webhook handler that is used by Import2 to notify your app about import progress</li>
</ul>
